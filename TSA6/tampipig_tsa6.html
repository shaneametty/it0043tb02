            <p class="desc"> (セバスチャン・ミカエリス, Sebasuchan Mikaerisu) is the demon butler and a senior staff member of the Phantomhive household. Sebastian's real home is in an alternate world that is quite different from the human world. In particular, he mentioned that the creatures kept as pets there are in no way comparable to cats. Furthermore, Sebastian existed for a rather long period of time, and therefore, he occasionally muses that Ciel Phantomhive's life in comparison would feel like an instant. Sebastian is devoted to Ciel Phantomhive. He faithfully carries out every one of Ciel's orders while ensuring that the Phantomhive household runs smoothly as the head butler. He does not sleep—demons deem sleep a luxury—and often spends his nights fulfilling his duties. He is sometimes critical of his master and how he treats his workers, but once admitted that he is not averse to the butler lifestyle despite the concomitant daily troubles. One of his quirks is that he always responds to Ciel's orders with the saying "Yes, my lord (御意イエス ご主人様マイロード )."</p>

A chess prodigy, he often navigates challenging situations by visualizing making chess moves, with Sebastian as his pawn. His paramount goal is to exact revenge on those who harmed him and his family, and he is willing to sacrifice his soul to accomplish it. </p>

In order for Lau to conduct business in England's "underworld," he must follow Ciel Phantomhive's orders to the letter. That being so, Ciel has left the administration of the Oriental quarter, the East End, and black-market docks to Lau. Lau is a placid, even-tempered individual who is apt to make facetious remarks and act as though he is aware and well-informed of an important matter, only to later reveal that he is, in truth, clueless; Sebastian Michaelis believes that he simply chimes in whenever "he thought it appropriate."Moreover, he is frequently accompanied by the female attendants of the opium den he manages. He refers to his personal assassin, Ran-Mao, as his sister, although they are not related by blood.</p>

            <p class="desc"> (グレル・サトクリフ, Gureru Satokurifu) is a Grim Reaper. She is part of the Retrieval Division of the Grim Reaper Dispatch. Grelle initially posed as Angelina Dalles's butler and conspired with her as Jack the Ripper. She was suspended for some time as a result, but is now a fully active Grim Reaper.Grelle is an outspoken, flamboyant individual who unreservedly expresses herself and her desires. She possesses a strong predilection for the color red, which she believes can be used to achieve beauty.Combative, Grelle is quick to turn to violence to eliminate hindrances and has had numerous clashes with Sebastian Michaelis because of such an inclination. She has little to no patience for those who are bogged down by her emotions, having ruthlessly slain partner-in-crime Angelina Dalles for hesitating to kill her nephew. At first, Grelle was dismissive of the principles of Grim Reapers, which includes staying neutral in human affairs, as evidenced by her unlawful partnership with Angelina. However, after a period of suspension, Grelle has come to respect said principles, enough to preach the importance of soul-reaping to fellow Grim Reaper Ronald Knox. Nevertheless, due to her impulsive nature, she is still liable to transgress these principles, such as when she attempted to kill Aleister Chamber while ignoring Ronald's warning that killing humans is prohibited.</p>
